Airhead - Python based ActiveSync Server
========================================

The Airhead project implements an ActiveSync server. It is intended to be a
light solution that is easy to install, configure and use. The objective is to
provide an ActiveSync server that can be used as either standalone server or a
module for other projects (e.g. Radicale see http://www.radicale.org).

Airhead runs on most of the UNIX-like platforms (Linux, BSD, MacOS X) and
Windows. It is free and open-source software, released under GPL version 3.
